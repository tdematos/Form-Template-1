# Form-Template-1
I created this form created using HTML & CSS.

HTML
- This is what I used to Structure the content.
  -> I need to structure the form in a certain way, so that later it would be easier to manipulate using CSS.
- I also used this to create my form.
- When creating the form, I was focusing on validations.
  -> I did this by entering specific lengths, and adding the "required" field to the appropriate element.
